This is an example of calculating the binding energy between a Mg2+ ion and a water molecule. The geometry is obtained from DFT.

There are two runs here. The "run1.py" will calculate the binding energy using standard AMBERFF99SB force field and the water model you choose. The "run2.py" will add a 12-6-4 LJ term to the Mg-O interaction with parameters from J.Chem.Theory.Comput,2013,9,2733.

Same calculations can be done using the GUI.
